            Due to the diverse culture present in the Indian subcontinent, Indians are coerced to buy new clothes and jewellery for festivals and occasions.Many individuals have their wardrobe filled as they have purchased clothes or jewellery for one-time occasion which they no longer need. <br />

            Individuals experience an impulse to buy new outfits which they will wear for a few times or probably not wear the outfit again, thus wasting a lump sum amount of money on them. The waste that is contributed by the individuals in the fashion industry is enormous and leads to many uncertain events. <br />

            Hence, it is necessary to build a green ecological civilization and one of the methods that can be implemented is the clothing renting system.

            <br />
            <br />

            A literature review suggested that previous studies on Fashion Rental are limited to understanding usersâ€™ motivations and behavioral intentions. While this is often informative in that it provides how to improve the renting service for  people that  are already using the service,  it&apos;s  still unclear on how to expand the market by attracting new customers into the Fashion Rental market.

            <br />
            <br />

            To make fashion sustainable we have introduced Ramp Ready to help you pick up outfits for your next happening occasion. <br />

              <li>
                In the project, we are going to build a website that will help others to rent branded clothes at affordable prices on a day or hourly basis.
              </li>

                The customers can rent clothes of their choice through the website from various shops and individuals according to their needs.
              </li>
              <li>
                We will also provide the rentee with the location of the stores and individuals nearby so that they can directly reach the businesses.
              </li>
              <li>
                The website will act as a medium between the rentees and stores/individuals who are willing to rent their clothes or accessories : the rentee can afford fashionable outfits, the businesses will have a chance to increase their sales and we will be able to make profit from both the sides.
